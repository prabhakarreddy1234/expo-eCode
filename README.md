Possible future changes :

1. ES6 could be used. As few browsers doesnt support ES6 yet, we have to use tranpiler like Bable to transpile ES6 into ES5
2. Some bundling framework could be used  like browserify or webpack (for browser)
3. Could implement task runner to perform some tasks like build, copy, lint, transpile, bundle etc
